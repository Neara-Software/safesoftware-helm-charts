Congratulations, your FME Flow Remote Engines Service Deployment should be ready shortly! You can check the progress of the deployment by typing:

  $ kubectl -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} get pods

Once all containers are running, you should be able to access your deployment under {{ template "fmeflow.deployment.protocol" . }}://{{ .Values.deployment.hostname }}

To uninstall/delete FME Flow (this deletes all data):
  $ helm uninstall {{ .Release.Name }} -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}
